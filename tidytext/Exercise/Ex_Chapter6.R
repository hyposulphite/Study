#?# get data AssociatedPress

#?# create ap_lda: conduct LDA with k=2

#?# create ap_topics: tidy beta matrix

#?# create ap_top_terms: get top 10 words that define the two topics

#?# plot the words

#?# find words making greatest difference between topic1 and topic2

#?#   difference defined as log2(topic2/topic1)

### 6.1.2 Document-topic probabilities

#?# create ap_documents: from ap_lda get tidy version of gamma matrix 

#?#   gamma matrix: per-document-per-topic probability

#?# check why document 6 has high topic 2 probability

### 6.2 Example: the great library heist

#?# create books: download from gutenberg:

#?# create by_chapter: divide into documents, each representing one chapter

#?# create by_chapter_word: split into words

#?# create word_counts: word counts

### 6.2.1 LDA on chapters

#?# create chapters_dtm: get dtm from word_counts

#?# create chapters_lda: LDA with k=4

#?# create chapter_topics: pull out beta matrix for the topics

#?# get top 5 terms by topics and plot

### 6.2.2 Per-document classification

#?# create chapters_gamma: pull out gamm matrix

#?# summarize gamma by book and topic and do classification

#?# check the cases of misclassification

###6.2.3 By word assignments: augment

#?# create assignments: assign words in chapters_lda into each topic

#?# update assignments: check correctness of assignments

#?# plot confusion matrix: how often the misclassification

#?# research on the wrong words

###6.3 Alternative LDA implementations
